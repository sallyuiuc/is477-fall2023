IS477 Fall 2023 Assignment 3

This example uses the adult_reconstruction.csv described in:

  Ding, F., Hardt, M., Miller, J., & Schmidt, L. (2021).
  Retiring Adult: New Datasets for Fair Machine Learning.
  Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 6478–6490.

The purpose of this script is to implement a standard logistic
regression model training on the reconstructed data to compare to the
results reported in the paper.
