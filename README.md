Analysis

a. Do the regression results match those reported in the original paper for the UCI Adult data?

To compare the results of your reproduction with the original paper, you should provide a summary of the accuracy results obtained from running reproducing_adult.py. You can analyze and compare the accuracy metrics you obtained with those reported in the original paper. Mention any significant discrepancies, if present, and discuss possible reasons for the differences.

b. Do the regression results using the reconstructed data with the default threshold match the results of the regression using the original UCI Adult data?

In this section, summarize the results obtained from running reproducing_reconstruction.py with the default threshold. Compare these results to those obtained from running reproducing_adult.py (original UCI Adult data). Analyze whether the accuracy results with the reconstructed data match those of the original UCI Adult data. Discuss any similarities or differences you observe.
